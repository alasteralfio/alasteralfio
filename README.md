# 💫 About Me:
Hey! My name is Alaster, I'm an intermediate-level developer based in Singapore, and am currently a 2nd year student, studying for my diploma in digital design and development. Most of my projects are coded in Python, though I'm also proficient at web development with JavaScript.

# 🎁 What I'm up to:
🔭 I’m currently working on a VR psychological horror game!<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning better soft skills, AI and automation and advanced programming concepts!<br>
💬 Ask me about anything Python related! I'd be glad to help.
