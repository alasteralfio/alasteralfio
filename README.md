# 💫 About Me:
Hey! My name is Alaster, I'm an intermediate-level developer based in Singapore, and am currently a 3rd year student, studying for my diploma in digital design and development. Most of my projects are coded in Python, though I'm proficient proficient in many other languages and technology, the largest of them being back-end Web Development with Node.js! <br>

I'm turning 19 this year, and though I may seem young, my journey in programming started a decade ago when I was 9! I started with little projects on Scratch, and took my first step into script-based programming with MicroBit and shortly thereafter, Arduino! 

# 🎁 What I'm up to:
I’m currently working on a VR psychological horror game, made in Unity!<br>
I’m currently developing a curriculum for my school's club in order to teach other students various things in IT, such as machine learning, automation, and web development!<br>
I'm currently developing an AI web-scraping program!
